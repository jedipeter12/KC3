# Roadmap

This file tracks project state. It should describe what is finished, what is being worked on, and what is likely next.

## Current Objective

Deliver the approved list-first Expo MVP over the existing anonymous public data
boundary.

## In Progress

- [ ] No implementation ticket is active; the place-list UI is the next ready
  ticket.

## Next

- [ ] Build the place list with loading, empty, and sanitized error states.
- [ ] Add client-side name search and city/place-type filters.
- [ ] Verify the list-first slice on mobile and Expo Web, including baseline
  accessibility checks.
- [ ] Add application and database checks to CI after the client tooling is
  selected.
- [ ] Approve a server-controlled, least-privilege administrative import and
  curation path; never expose privileged Supabase credentials to a client.
- [ ] Decide raw Google payload retention/privacy rules before ingestion.
- [ ] Define the Google import workflow and any later curated seed expansion.
- [ ] Select hosting and release tooling when deployment work is approved.

## Later

- [ ] Evaluate post-MVP product ideas only after the first MVP boundary is
  approved.
- [ ] Consider a separate web frontend only if requirements such as public search
  discoverability justify it.
- [ ] Consider more autonomous delivery orchestration after the supervised
  workflow is proven and repeatable.

## Completed

- [x] Repository initialized
- [x] Initial working stack approved: TypeScript, React Native/Expo, Expo Web, and
  Supabase/PostgreSQL.
- [x] Repository-centered roles and supervised delivery workflow documented.
- [x] Documentation gap analysis completed against the 2026-08-19 conversation
  context.
- [x] MVP place data model approved.
- [x] Initial Supabase migration authored with RLS enabled and no permissive
  policies.
- [x] Defensive repository security review completed; deny-by-default grants,
  signup closure, and credential ignore rules added.
- [x] pgTAP regression coverage and PostgreSQL lint commands added for the
  approved MVP data model.
- [x] Initial Supabase schema hardened, tested, approved, and merged.
- [x] Transactional, rerunnable local MVP seed added, reviewed, and merged with 15
  representative Lenexa, Overland Park, and Olathe places and seed-specific
  regression coverage.
- [x] Anonymous public place boundary approved and implemented as a read-only RPC
  limited to active place IDs, names, cities, addresses, and place types, with
  dedicated-role, RLS, privilege, status, column, and write-denial tests.
- [x] List-first Expo MVP approved with an anonymous place list, client-side name
  search and city/place-type filters, loading/empty/error states, and no map,
  accounts, writes, hours, or place-detail screen.
- [x] Prioritized implementation and historical tickets captured in the KC3
  Notion tracker while retaining this roadmap as the source of truth.
- [x] Expo SDK 57 TypeScript application scaffolded with a documented `src/` and
  `tests/` structure, Node/npm pinning, Jest, ESLint, Prettier, strict typechecking,
  and verified Web/iOS/Android export commands.
- [x] Expo-safe public Supabase client configured with documented public
  environment variables, sanitized validation, an exact five-field RPC type,
  focused unit coverage, and no privileged client credentials (KC3-15).
- [x] Typed public-place data layer implemented over `list_public_places()` with
  ordered exact-field results, explicit empty behavior, sanitized application
  errors, and focused client-level tests (KC3-16).

## Deferred / Rejected

Use this section for ideas intentionally postponed or rejected so they are not repeatedly rediscovered.

- Lyfe project implementation is parked while KC3 establishes the initial
  product-to-deployment workflow.
- User accounts, user submissions, freshness reports, "I'm working here" status,
  notifications, community/social features, complex moderation, and real-time
  occupancy are not approved MVP work. They remain tentative future ideas.
- Autonomous multi-agent orchestration is not required for the initial workflow.

## Known Bugs / Issues

- No runtime bugs are known. The place-list UI has not started.
